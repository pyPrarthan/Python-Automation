Learned about XPATH, what is it and why it is used?

XPath Overview
XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language used for selecting nodes from XML documents. 
It provides a way to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document using a path-like syntax.

Why XPath is Used ?
Navigation: XPath allows you to navigate through XML documents and select nodes or sets of nodes based on various criteria.
Querying: It enables filtering and querying XML data to find specific information.
Data Extraction: XPath is often used in conjunction with XSLT and other technologies to extract and transform XML data.
